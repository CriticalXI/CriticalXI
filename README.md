Hi, I'm Critical. I occasionally work on FFXI private servers.

I'm not currently associated with any servers, just contributing to the main FFXI repo LandSandBoat.

#### Current projects
- Condense all work from various FFXI repo forks ([AirSkyBoat](https://github.com/AirSkyBoat/AirSkyBoat), [FFXIWings](https://gitlab.com/ffxiwings/wings)) into LSB
- Get LSB content complete, working expansion by expansion. See my [FFXI work tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y3s3x5FruIgxiN83K8KuR8orXEAZHCw8sKnDtUTG32o) for current progress, feel free to reach out if you'd like to help.
